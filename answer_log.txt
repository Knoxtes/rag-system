QUESTION: I have a client interested in a website. What are the next steps?

ANSWER:
The process for a client interested in a website project is a five-step process, beginning with the Onboarding meeting.

Here are the next steps:
Step 01: Onboarding Meeting
   Purpose: This is the first step in the website development process. The goal is to discuss the client's wants, needs, and goals to define a vision and direction for the site's design and functionality.
   Attendees: The client will be joined by several members of the Creative Team.
   Outcome: Following the meeting, a recap email will be sent outlining the assets (images, logos, text, etc.) needed from the client to create the initial design mockup.
Step 02: Design Mockup
   Timeline: Once all requested assets are received from the client, the design mockup is built in approximately 2–3 weeks.
   Review & Approval: The client reviews the mockup and should request any adjustments at this time.
   Agreement: Once the client approves the mockup, they sign an agreement stating that no additional design changes will be made during the development phase.
Step 03: Development
   Timeline: Development can take up to 4 weeks, depending on the website's size and level of functionality (e.g., Essential Website vs. E-Commerce Website).
   Process: The creative team conducts an internal review before sending the developed product to the client for final review and approval.
Step 04: Final Review & Launch
   Client Review: The client receives the developed website for final approval. They should review the site on multiple devices (desktop, mobile) to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
   Launch: Once the client conducts a review and approves the site, it is set for launch.
Step 05: Hosting & Maintenance
   Start Date: This recurring service begins on the date the website is launched.
   Invoicing: The client is invoiced annually on the month of the launch.
   Maintenance: Maintenance requests (up to two hours monthly of update requests are typically included) can be sent to the Account Executive and/or the Project Manager (with a 2–3 business day turnaround). Technical issues or concerns are sent directly to the Project Manager and are addressed urgently.

Note on Client Materials:
The client will need to provide materials (logos, images, text, etc.). Before using these, the client typically signs a Client-Provided Materials Release and Indemnification Agreement** to assure the company that the client owns the materials or has secured all necessary licenses to use them without infringing on any third-party rights.

QUESTION: How long does it take to create a logo?

ANSWER:
The timeline for logo creation is integrated into the broader Brand Development process, which is structured in several steps:
Onboarding Meeting (Step 01): This initial meeting is where the team discusses the client's vision, including visual style, logo, and color schemes. This provides the creative team with a direction to start development.
Internal Creative Brief (Step 02): The creative team reviews the details from the Onboarding call and develops concepts.
Brand Concept Presentation (Step 03): A Brand Concept Presentation is created and presented to the client within 2–3 weeks of the initial process start.
Visual Development (Step 04 - Logo Concepts Shared): Once a final Brand concept is decided upon, visual development begins. The account representative will share the initial logo concepts with the client within two weeks of this step.
Revisions and Finalization: The client is allotted two rounds of revisions for the logo concepts, which should be made promptly. Once final approval is given, a fully developed Brand Identity Kit (which includes the logo) is provided to the client within one week.

In summary, the client can expect to see initial logo concepts approximately 2–3 weeks after the initial onboarding meeting, with the final logo delivered after the revision and approval process is complete.

Locate the File: If you need the actual file path for the existing media kit, you would need to perform a targeted search for the document name (e.g., livedrivesearch("Media Kit 2024.pdf")).

QUESTION: What is the average time to develop a website?

ANSWER:
The time to develop a website varies depending on the project phase and the complexity of the site:
Design Mockup Phase: Once all requested assets are received from the client, the initial design mockup is built in about 2–3 weeks.
Development Phase: This phase can take up to 4 weeks, depending on the website's size and level of functionality (e.g., whether it's an Essential Website or an E-Commerce Website).

Therefore, from the start of the design phase (after the initial Onboarding meeting and asset collection) to the completion of development, the process typically takes 4 to 7 weeks before the final review and launch.

QUESTION: I have a client interested in onboarding. What are the next steps?

ANSWER:
I am unable to find any documents detailing the specific client onboarding process or workflow in the indexed database.

To provide you with the next steps, I would need access to documents such as a "Client Onboarding Guide," "Project Initiation Checklist," or "Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for New Clients."

If you can provide a more specific folder name where this information might be located (e.g., "Operations Manuals" or "Sales Process"), I can try a targeted search.

QUESTION: I have a client interested in onboarding. What are the next steps?

ANSWER:
The client onboarding process is the crucial first step for any project, whether it's website development, brand development, or a corporate branding identity project.

The next steps for your client will center around the Onboarding Meeting and the subsequent collection of necessary assets.

Here is a synthesized, step-by-step workflow for client onboarding:

Phase 1: Onboarding Meeting & Asset Collection (Step 1)

The first and most critical step is the Onboarding Meeting.
Schedule the Onboarding Meeting: Your Account Representative will arrange a call with the client and members of the Creative Team (which may include the Art Director).
       Purpose: To brainstorm, discuss, and collaborate on the client's wants, needs, goals, and vision for the project (e.g., website design, brand identity, video concept).
       Outcome: By the end of this call, the team will have an established starting point and direction for the project's development.

Send Recap and Asset Request: Following the meeting, a recap email will be sent to the client outlining the specific assets required to begin the creative process.
       Required Assets (General): High-quality transparent PNG of the logo, high-resolution video (if existing footage is available), and high-quality photos (as many as possible).
       Source: 7MC Forward Facing - Website Process Infographic - 8.5x11.png, MotionVideoProcess.pdf
Secure Materials Release Agreement: Ensure the client signs the Client-Provided Materials Release and Indemnification Agreement.
       Purpose: This agreement grants the company a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the client's materials (images, logos, text, etc.) for the project and ensures the client warrants they have the legal right to use those materials.
       Source: Materials Release Agreement

Phase 2: Internal & Creative Development (Steps 2 & 3)

Once all assets are received, the project moves into the internal development phase.

| Project Type | Next Step (Step 2) | Next Step (Step 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Website Development | Design Mockup: Build a design mockup (approx. 2-3 weeks). | Development: Begins after mockup approval (can take up to 4 weeks). |
| Brand Development | Internal Creative Brief: Creative team reviews onboarding details and develops concepts. | Brand Concept Presentation: Presentation created within 2-3 weeks for client feedback and revisions (up to three concept revisions typically allotted). |
| Corporate Branding | Design Mock-ups: Create requested design concepts within 2-3 weeks. | Revisions & Final Review: Client reviews mock-ups and requests revisions (two rounds of revisions are allotted per project). |
