    "question": "I have a client interested in a website. What are the next steps?",
    "answer": "The process for a client interested in a website project is a five-step process, beginning with the Onboarding meeting.\n\nHere are the next steps:\nStep 01: Onboarding Meeting\n   Purpose: This is the first step in the website development process. The goal is to discuss the client's wants, needs, and goals to define a vision and direction for the site's design and functionality.\n   Attendees: The client will be joined by several members of the Creative Team.\n   Outcome: Following the meeting, a recap email will be sent outlining the assets (images, logos, text, etc.) needed from the client to create the initial design mockup.\nStep 02: Design Mockup\n   Timeline: Once all requested assets are received from the client, the design mockup is built in approximately 2–3 weeks.\n   Review & Approval: The client reviews the mockup and should request any adjustments at this time.\n   Agreement: Once the client approves the mockup, they sign an agreement stating that no additional design changes will be made during the development phase.\nStep 03: Development\n   Timeline: Development can take up to 4 weeks, depending on the website's size and level of functionality (e.g., Essential Website vs. E-Commerce Website).\n   Process: The creative team conducts an internal review before sending the developed product to the client for final review and approval.\nStep 04: Final Review & Launch\n   Client Review: The client receives the developed website for final approval. They should review the site on multiple devices (desktop, mobile) to ensure optimal performance and functionality.\n   Launch: Once the client conducts a review and approves the site, it is set for launch.\nStep 05: Hosting & Maintenance\n   Start Date: This recurring service begins on the date the website is launched.\n   Invoicing: The client is invoiced annually on the month of the launch.\n   Maintenance: Maintenance requests (up to two hours monthly of update requests are typically included) can be sent to the Account Executive and/or the Project Manager (with a 2–3 business day turnaround). Technical issues or concerns are sent directly to the Project Manager and are addressed urgently.\n\nNote on Client Materials:\nThe client will need to provide materials (logos, images, text, etc.). Before using these, the client typically signs a Client-Provided Materials Release and Indemnification Agreement** to assure the company that the client owns the materials or has secured all necessary licenses to use them without infringing on any third-party rights.",

    "question": "How long does it take to create a logo?",
    "answer": "The timeline for logo creation is integrated into the broader Brand Development process, which is structured in several steps:\nOnboarding Meeting (Step 01): This initial meeting is where the team discusses the client's vision, including visual style, logo, and color schemes. This provides the creative team with a direction to start development.\nInternal Creative Brief (Step 02): The creative team reviews the details from the Onboarding call and develops concepts.\nBrand Concept Presentation (Step 03): A Brand Concept Presentation is created and presented to the client within 2–3 weeks of the initial process start.\nVisual Development (Step 04 - Logo Concepts Shared): Once a final Brand concept is decided upon, visual development begins. The account representative will share the initial logo concepts with the client within two weeks of this step.\nRevisions and Finalization: The client is allotted two rounds of revisions for the logo concepts, which should be made promptly. Once final approval is given, a fully developed Brand Identity Kit (which includes the logo) is provided to the client within one week.\n\nIn summary, the client can expect to see initial logo concepts approximately 2–3 weeks after the initial onboarding meeting, with the final logo delivered after the revision and approval process is complete.",
