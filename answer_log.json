    "question": "I have a client interested in a website, what are the next steps",
    "answer": "The next steps for a client interested in a website fall under the Digital & Creative Services pillar of the business. This process involves coordination between the sales team (Branding Specialists) and the Creative Services team.\n\nBased on the available information regarding digital service delivery and project management, here are the key next steps and internal actions:\n\n### Client Onboarding and Project Initiation\n\n1.  **Confirm Scope and Contract:**\n    *   Ensure the client has formally agreed to the website design and development services.\n    *   The sales staff (Branding Specialists) are responsible for selling the full suite of digital services, including website design, and are not limited by geographic boundaries.\n    *   If the client is new or the project involves sensitive information, consider utilizing a **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**. A template for an NDA is available in the resources.\n        *   *Source: [Non-Disclosure Agreement Template.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LK7-NRZXbNz-FwmiuqBeYDkZj5kj_OR1/view)*\n\n2.  **Initiate Project Workflow (Trello/VICI):**\n    *   The digital project workflow relies on specific tools for tracking and communication.\n    *   **Trello Board:** If your market and team rely on the Trello Board for updates, you must **update the cards in a timely manner** to enable the entire team to check the status of the account in the digital process. This should be part of your daily morning routine.\n    *   **VICI Portal:** Log in daily to the Reporting Zone to check over your workflow tasks and monitor status changes for RFPs (Request for Proposals) and IOs (Insertion Orders). This should also be a daily routine.\n        *   *Source: [Remote Work Communications for Digital Strategists - Protocol.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6hLVWZYjt6rVv1lYUr78c_BqARQjoiS/view)*\n\n3.  **Internal Handoff and Assignment:**\n    *   The project will be managed by the Creative Services team, overseen by the **Creative Services Project Manager (Samantha Radford)** and the **Director of Integrated Marketing and Digital (Wendy Lynch)**.\n    *   Ensure the project details, client requirements, and any necessary creative assets are handed off to the Creative Services Project Manager to begin the design and development phase.\n\n### Creative and Content Considerations\n\n*   **Image Use Policy:** As the project moves into the design phase, all staff contributing content to the client's website must comply with the Image Use Policy. This policy requires using only images approved for public use, such as stock images, photographs, and clip art expressly labeled as free for reuse and republishing.\n    *   *Source: [Handbook 2024](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I2Hl9_ru3XggpewrKwsC0rIL1mVPBNGP_14Hcb78tPc/edit)*\n*   **Integrated Approach:** Remember that website design and development are part of the company's \"Digital & Creative Services\" pillar, which utilizes a **360-degree marketing approach**. This means the website project should be integrated with other potential services like SEO, digital advertising, and video content to ensure cohesive brand messaging.\n    *   *Source: [seven_mountains_media_rag_kb.md.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2gBbjg-gFgAMpuOINKdOSZwrnaYg9vU/view)*",
