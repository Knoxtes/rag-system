## Website Development Services

### Q: I have a client interested in a website. What are the next steps?

**Answer**: To initiate a website development project, please follow these steps:

1. **Schedule a Client Needs Assessment (CNA)**: Contact Gavin Walters directly at gwalters@7mountainsmedia.com to schedule a comprehensive needs assessment meeting with the client.

2. **Review Internal Documentation**: Before the CNA, familiarize yourself with our creative process documentation available in the shared drive. This will help you prepare relevant questions and set appropriate expectations with the client.

3. **Project Scoping**: During the CNA, we'll identify the client's requirements, goals, timeline expectations, and budget parameters to ensure we can deliver a solution that meets their needs.

### Q: What is the average timeline to develop a website?

**Answer**: Website development timelines vary significantly based on project complexity and scope. There is no universal "average" timeline because each project has unique variables that affect the schedule, including:

- **Project Scope**: Number of pages, custom functionality requirements, e-commerce integration, content management needs
- **Design Complexity**: Custom design vs. template-based, number of unique page layouts, interactive elements
- **Content Availability**: The most common factor affecting timeline is timely receipt of content (text, images, videos) from the client
- **Revision Cycles**: Number of feedback rounds and client approval stages
- **Third-party Integrations**: API connections, payment gateways, CRM systems, analytics setup

**Important**: We cannot provide an accurate timeline estimate without first scoping the project through a Client Needs Assessment (CNA). Once we understand the full scope, we can provide a realistic project timeline with milestone dates.

**Best Practice**: Set client expectations early that their responsiveness in providing content and feedback directly impacts the project completion date.

### Q: What's the difference between a landing page and a full website?

**Answer**: 

**Landing Page**:
- A single, focused web page designed for a specific marketing campaign or conversion goal
- Typically contains targeted content with a single call-to-action (CTA)
- Used for lead generation, product launches, event registration, or promotional campaigns
- Limited navigation to keep visitors focused on the primary conversion goal
- Faster to develop and deploy (typically 1-2 weeks)
- Lower cost investment compared to full website development

**Full Website**:
- Multi-page digital presence with comprehensive information architecture
- Includes homepage, about pages, services/products pages, contact forms, blog, etc.
- Multiple navigation paths and user journeys
- Serves as the primary online hub for business information, branding, and customer engagement
- Longer development timeline (typically 4-12+ weeks depending on scope)
- Higher investment but provides complete digital presence

**Use Case Recommendations**:
- Choose a landing page for: time-sensitive campaigns, specific product launches, lead generation initiatives, A/B testing
- Choose a full website for: establishing comprehensive online presence, ongoing content marketing, multiple service offerings, brand authority building

### Q: My client needs to make an update to their website. Who should they contact?

**Answer**: Website update procedures depend on the client's current service agreement:

**For Clients with Active Hosting & Maintenance Plans**:
- Direct all update requests and technical support issues through our official ticket system at **help.7mountainsmedia.com**
- This ensures proper tracking, prioritization, and documentation of all requests
- Clients will receive automatic email confirmations and status updates on their tickets
- Average response time: 24-48 business hours for standard requests

**Important Notes**:
- Hosting & maintenance clients receive 2 hours of website updates per month as part of their service plan
- Updates are processed in the order received based on complexity and available hours
- Urgent updates may require additional fees if they exceed the included hours

**For Clients Without Maintenance Plans**:
- Contact the Project Manager to discuss project-based pricing for updates
- Updates will be billed as separate creative services projects

---

### Q: Can a client use their 2 hours of hosting and maintenance updates for other creative services such as social media posts?

**Answer**: No. The 2 hours of monthly updates included in hosting and maintenance packages are **exclusively allocated for website-related updates only**. This includes:

**Eligible Updates** (within the 2-hour allocation):
- Content updates (text, images, PDFs)
- Page layout adjustments
- Plugin updates and security patches
- Minor functionality tweaks
- Contact information changes
- Menu/navigation updates
- SEO metadata updates

**Non-Eligible Services** (require separate billing):
- Social media post design and creation
- Email newsletter design
- Print collateral (business cards, brochures, flyers)
- Logo design or modifications
- Video production or editing
- Photography services
- Any creative work not directly related to website maintenance

**Rationale**: The maintenance hours are specifically budgeted for website technical support and content management. Other creative services require different skill sets, tools, and time allocations, and are therefore billed separately using our standard creative services rates.

---

### Q: If my client does not use their 2 hours of updates per month, can they roll over hours?

**Answer**: No. The 2 hours of website updates included in monthly hosting and maintenance packages **do not roll over** from month to month. 

**Policy Details**:
- Update hours reset on the first day of each billing cycle
- Unused hours expire at the end of each monthly period
- This policy ensures predictable resource allocation and fair scheduling for all clients

**Recommendation**: Encourage clients to maintain a running list of minor updates throughout the month and submit them as a batch request to maximize the value of their included hours. Even small updates like:
- Updating business hours or contact information
- Adding new team member bios
- Refreshing seasonal promotional content
- Optimizing older content for SEO
- Replacing outdated images

**Alternative for Larger Projects**: If a client anticipates needing more than 2 hours of work in a given month, they can request a project quote for additional updates or upgrade to a higher-tier maintenance plan if available.

---

### Q: How do I bill for creative services?

**Answer**: Creative services billing follows our standardized process to ensure clear financial expectations and proper project authorization:

**Billing Procedure**:

1. **Use Official IO Forms**: All creative services must be documented using the Insertion Order (IO) forms available in the shared drive. These forms capture:
   - Detailed scope of work
   - Itemized pricing breakdown
   - Payment terms and schedule
   - Project timeline and deliverables
   - Client approval signatures

2. **Standard Payment Structure**:
   - **50% Deposit**: Due prior to the onboarding call and before any creative work begins
   - **50% Final Payment**: Due upon project completion and client approval of final deliverables
   - This split payment structure protects both the client and our company while ensuring commitment from both parties

3. **Project Manager Responsibilities**:
   - Collect a signed copy of the IO before scheduling the onboarding call
   - Verify that the initial 50% payment has been received before work commences
   - Hold final deliverables until the remaining 50% payment is received and processed
   - Maintain IO documentation for financial records and project archives

**Important Notes**:
- Large projects (typically over $5,000) may have custom payment schedules with milestone-based payments
- Rush projects may require 100% payment upfront
- Retainer agreements follow different billing structures as outlined in the retainer contract
- All pricing and payment terms must be clearly communicated to clients in writing before work begins

## Logo Design Services

### Q: How long does it take to create a logo?

**Answer**: Logo design is a collaborative, multi-phase process that balances creative excellence with timely delivery. Our standard timeline is structured as follows:

**Standard Timeline**:
- **Initial Concepts**: First round of logo concepts is typically finalized and ready for presentation **2 weeks after the onboarding call**
- **Total Project Duration**: 3-6 weeks depending on revision cycles and client responsiveness

**Process Breakdown**:

1. **Discovery & Onboarding** (Week 1):
   - Client onboarding call to understand brand values, target audience, and design preferences

   - Mood board development and style direction

2. **Concept Development** (Week 2):
   - Initial design concepts created (typically 3-5 distinct directions)
   - Internal design review and refinement
   - Preparation of presentation materials

3. **First Presentation** (End of Week 2):
   - Present initial concepts to client
   - Gather detailed feedback on each direction

4. **Revision Rounds** (Weeks 3-4+):

   - Number of revision rounds varies by project complexity and client decisiveness
   - Additional rounds beyond the standard 2-3 may incur additional fees

5. **Finalization** (Final Week):
   - Final approval and sign-off
   - Production of all file formats
   - Delivery of complete logo package

**Timeline Variables**:
- **Client Responsiveness**: Faster feedback = shorter timeline

### Q: What is the difference between a logo and an illustration?

**Answer**: While both logos and illustrations are visual design elements, they serve distinctly different purposes and are created with different considerations in mind.

**LOGO**:

**Purpose**: A logo is a symbol of brand identity designed for consistent, widespread use across all marketing materials and platforms.

**Characteristics**:
- **Simplicity**: Clean, easily recognizable design that works at any size
- **Versatility**: Must function in full color, black & white, single color, and reverse applications
- **Scalability**: Looks sharp from business card size (½ inch) to billboard size (20+ feet)
- **Timelessness**: Designed to remain relevant for years or decades
- **Memorability**: Instantly recognizable and distinctively represents the brand
- **File Formats**: Delivered in vector format (AI, EPS, SVG) for infinite scalability

**Common Uses**:
- Business cards, letterhead, email signatures
- Website headers and favicons
- Social media profiles
- Signage and vehicle wraps
- Product packaging and labels
- Advertisements and marketing materials

**Pricing**: Logo design is typically billed as a comprehensive branding project ($2,000-$15,000+) including multiple concepts, revisions, and complete file packages.

---

**ILLUSTRATION**:

**Purpose**: An illustration is a custom artwork created for a specific application, campaign, or piece of content.

**Characteristics**:
- **Complexity**: Can be highly detailed and intricate
- **Context-Specific**: Designed for particular use case or medium
- **Artistic Expression**: More creative freedom and stylistic variation
- **Narrative**: Often tells a story or conveys a specific message
- **Medium-Dependent**: May be optimized for print, web, or specific size requirements
- **File Formats**: Delivered in appropriate format for intended use (may be raster or vector)

**Common Uses**:
- Magazine or book illustrations
- Infographics and data visualizations
- Marketing campaign artwork
- Website hero images or backgrounds
- Social media campaign graphics
- Editorial content
- Decorative elements for specific projects

**Pricing**: Illustrations are typically billed per project or per piece ($500-$5,000+) based on complexity, usage rights, and timeline.

---

**Key Distinction**:
- A **logo** is your brand's visual identity used everywhere, forever
- An **illustration** is custom artwork for a specific purpose or campaign

**Can They Overlap?**
Sometimes logos incorporate illustrative elements (called "illustrative marks"), but they must still maintain the core principles of logo design: simplicity, scalability, and versatility.

**Example**: 
- The Nike swoosh is a **logo** - simple, scalable, used everywhere
- A custom drawing of an athlete wearing Nike shoes for an ad campaign is an **illustration** - detailed, context-specific, created for that particular campaign

## Graphics and Design Support

### Q: How early do I need to put in a graphics request?

### Q: Can you update a DJ photo on the app?

**Answer**: Yes, we can update DJ photos on the mobile app. However, this requires proper image preparation to ensure consistent quality and branding across the app interface.

**Why You Need to Submit a Request**:
- **Size Requirements**: App photos require specific dimensions and aspect ratios
- **Brand Consistency**: Photos need consistent styling, background treatment, and formatting
- **Technical Specs**: Images must be optimized for both iOS and Android platforms
- **Quality Control**: Professional editing and formatting ensures a polished appearance

**How to Request App Photo Updates**:

1. **Submit Graphics Request**: Create a Trello card or ticket titled "App Photo Update - [DJ Name/Station]"

2. **Provide Information**:
   - **High-Quality Source Photo**: Upload the highest resolution version available (minimum 1000px wide)
   - **DJ/Personality Name**: Include correct spelling and any titles

   - Optimize file size for mobile app performance
   - Generate both iOS and Android versions

4. **Turnaround Time**: **3-5 business days** from request to app update completion

**Best Practices for Source Photos**:
- Use professional headshots when possible
- Ensure good lighting and high resolution
- Avoid busy backgrounds (solid backgrounds work best)
- Face should be clearly visible and well-lit
- Submit photos in JPG or PNG format

**Bulk Updates**: If updating multiple DJ photos at once, submit as a single request with all photos attached to streamline the process.

---

### Q: Can I design my own graphics?

**Answer**: Yes, we welcome and encourage team members to create content independently! However, to maintain brand consistency and professional standards across all stations and properties, there are important guidelines to follow.

**What You Can Design Freely**:
- Personal social media content unrelated to station business
- Internal team communications (if not using station branding)
- Informal, non-branded content for internal use
- Concept sketches or rough drafts for team discussion

**What Requires Approval**:
Any station-branded content that includes:
- **Station logos** or variations thereof
- **Official brand patterns** or design elements
- **Station-specific fonts** defined in brand guidelines
- **Official color schemes** from brand standards
- **Branded templates** or layouts

**Approval Process for Branded Content**:

1. **Create Your Design**: Use available templates or create from scratch
2. **Upload to Trello**: Before posting or distributing, add your design to Trello
3. **Request Feedback**: Tag the design team and request approval in the card description
4. **Provide Context**: Include where/how the graphic will be used and your intended posting date
5. **Wait for Approval**: Allow at least 24-48 hours for design team review
6. **Make Revisions**: Implement any requested changes before posting
7. **Final Approval**: Only post/distribute once the design team gives explicit approval

**Why This Matters**:
- **Brand Consistency**: Ensures all public-facing content maintains professional standards
- **Legal Protection**: Improper logo usage can create legal or trademark issues
- **Quality Control**: Prevents off-brand content from reaching audiences
- **Professional Image**: Maintains credibility and brand value across all touchpoints

**Resources Available**:
- Official brand guidelines for each station
- Approved templates for common needs (social posts, event graphics, etc.)
- Logo files in various formats
- Font libraries and color palettes
- Design best practices documentation

**Training Available**: If you're interested in creating more branded content, ask about brand guidelines training sessions offered by the Creative team.

**Questions?**: If unsure whether your design needs approval, err on the side of caution and submit it for review. The design team is happy to provide quick feedback.

### Q: Can I use a social media graphic as a badge on the app/website?

**Answer**: No. Social media graphics and app/website badges are designed for fundamentally different technical requirements and user experiences. They are not interchangeable.

**Why Social Media Graphics Don't Work as Badges**:

**Size Constraints**:
- **Badges** display at very small sizes (often 50-150 pixels)
- **Social graphics** are designed for larger viewing (1080px+)
- Text and details that are clear in social posts become illegible when shrunk to badge size

**Design Complexity**:
- **Badges** must be simple, clean, and instantly recognizable at thumbnail size
- **Social graphics** can include detailed information, multiple text elements, and complex designs
- Background patterns and gradients that work for social become muddy in small badge format

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Badges** require transparent backgrounds (PNG format)
- **Badges** need to work on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Badges** must be optimized for retina/high-DPI displays
- **Badges** have specific aspect ratios (often square or specific rectangles)

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- **Badges** prioritize icon/symbol over text
- **Badges** use minimal or no text (logo/symbol recognition)
- **Social graphics** are designed to be read and include promotional copy

**Examples of Badge-Appropriate Designs**:
- Station logo in circular format
- Simple icon representing a show or feature
- Minimalist symbol with high contrast
- Clean, recognizable shapes and colors

**How to Request Proper Badges**:

1. **Submit Separate Request**: Create a new Trello card specifically for badge creation
2. **Specify Usage**: Clearly indicate this is for app/website badge use
3. **Provide Requirements**: Include exact dimensions and technical specifications
4. **Reference Examples**: Link to similar badges already in use if available
5. **Turnaround**: Allow 3-5 business days for custom badge design

**Best Practice**: Always request badges as separate design projects rather than trying to repurpose existing marketing graphics. The design team will create optimized versions specifically for small-format display.

## Trello Support and Access

### Q: Trello isn't loading. Can you help?

**Answer**: If Trello is experiencing loading issues or technical difficulties, this is typically due to platform-level issues outside of our direct control.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1. **Check Platform Status**: 
   - Visit **trello.status.atlassian.com** to check if Atlassian (Trello's parent company) is reporting any known issues or outages
   - This status page shows real-time information about service disruptions, scheduled maintenance, or technical incidents

2. **Try Basic Troubleshooting**:
   - **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
   - **Clear browser cache** and cookies for Trello
   - **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - **Check your internet connection**
   - **Try the Trello mobile app** as an alternative
   - **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere with Trello

3. **Report the Issue**:
   - If the status page shows no known issues but you're still experiencing problems, report it through the Atlassian support page
   - Provide specific details: error messages, browser version, what you were trying to do when the issue occurred

4. **Alternative Workflows**:
   - While Trello is down, document urgent requests via email to the appropriate department
   - Once Trello is restored, add those requests to the proper boards for tracking
   - Check with team members to see if others are experiencing the same issue (helps determine if it's a widespread outage or a local issue)

**Resource**: [Trello Status Page](https://trello.status.atlassian.com/)

**Internal IT Support**: If you suspect the issue is specific to your account or device (not a platform-wide issue), contact internal IT support for additional troubleshooting assistance.

**Communication During Outages**: If Trello is confirmed down, the Creative department will announce alternative communication methods via email or team chat until service is restored.

- Accept the invitation
- Create or log into their Trello account
- Set up their profile
- Review board structures and processes

**Training Resources**: Direct new Trello users to internal documentation or schedule a brief orientation with their team lead to explain board organization and workflow processes.

**Security Note**: For employee terminations or security-sensitive situations, clearly mark your email as "URGENT" and consider following up with a phone call to ensure prompt action.

**Partial Access Changes**: If someone needs access adjusted (moved between boards) rather than complete removal, specify the desired final state in your request.

**Compliance**: User access removal requests are logged for security compliance and audit purposes.
